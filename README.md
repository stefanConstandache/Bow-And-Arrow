# Bow-And-Arrow

**Description**
- The project is a replica of the Bow and Arrow 2D game.
- It has a simple interface:
  - the menu in the starting/ending screen
  - in the playing screen: 
    - the player can move the arrow up and down
    - shoot with less or more power depending on how much time he pressed the left mouse button (the shooting button)
- In the playing screen there are some objects that grant points:
  - red ballons +10 points
  - yellow ballons -5 points
  - shuriken +1 point
- Also when the shuriken hits the player (the bow) he gets minus one life.
- The gravity of the arrow is implemented with the help of physics equations.
- The aim of the player is to shoot as many red ballons as possible to increase his score and to avoid beeing hit by shurikens.
- The objectives of this homework were:
  - Getting used to OpenGL libraries
  - Getting used to the 2D transformations (translation, rotation, scaling)

**Languages**
- The project was developed using c++ and the OpenGL framework.
